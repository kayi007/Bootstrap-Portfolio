                        <p id="specialP">Hello! My name is Kathleen and I was born on a pacific island called Saipan. I'm Chinese but I consider myself a Pacidic Islander. I moved around a lot as a kid. English used to be my first language but when I was 5 years old, my parents decided to send me to Shanghai to learn Chinese and that was when I forgot all of my English. I went back to Saipan when I was 10, then 5 years later I came here to California in 2011, because my parents wanted me to get a better education.</p>
            
                        <p>My parents were clueless about applying to colleges and what's needed to get into a good college. I somehow managed to figure it out all by myself and I was overjoyed to get into my dream school, UCLA. I graduated in 2017 with a major in Linguistics and a specialization in Computing.</p>

                        <p>I love the beaches, traveling, and learning new foreign languages. I have strong curiosity to view life from other perspectives and learn different ways. After giving away 3 summer breaks to summer school in college, I couldn't resist my wanderlust when I got out and I came up with a goal of doing 2 international trips and 1 domestic trip per year. In 2018, I went to Taiwan, Tokyo, Shanghai and Orlando. This year I've already been to Taiwan, Osaka, Kyoto, and Hawaii. By the end of this year I might go on a trip to Thailand and Singapore. Traveling force you to take in new and refreshing perspectives :)</p>
